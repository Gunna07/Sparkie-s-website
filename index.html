            <p>I am an educated, honest, 70 yr. old single lady, retired as a CEO/Pres/Founder of an International Non Profit Foundation. I am faith based, and happy. I live on the Gallatin River, which flows out of Yellowstone Park, in Montana. This is my tranquility and joy! I love anything to do with the outdoors.I have been a writer since the age of fifteen. I am published, and some of my work resides in the White House, in Washington, D.C. I don't have any pets at this time, but have had many animals over the course of my life. I have three grown children, and three beautiful grandkids. Life is great, and one day will be even better when my heart finds the right owner. Until then, I couldn't ask for anything else in this life to bring me joy and happiness. I have it all!</p>

       <i style="color: rgb(216, 44, 102);">My Self Perception:</i> 
        
        I see myself as a woman of grace and warmth, soft-spoken, caring, and respectful. Writing from the heart is my passion,
        and I love exploring emotions and sharing thoughts that might lift or inspire. I’m high-energy and work hard, but always
        with others in mind. Life has been full and rich, honored by some and connected with many. I’m a grateful grandmother to
        Berkley, Ashton, and Brooklyn, and every day feels surrounded by love, calm, and gratitude. After a rewarding career as
        CEO and founder of an international foundation, I’m now enjoying the simple, meaningful moments of life. <br>
        <i style="color: rgb(216, 44, 102);">Interests:</i> Camping, traveling, cooking, quilting, family and friends! 
        <br>
        <i>Favourite Films: </i> The Edge, P.S I Love You, River Wild, Pretty Woman, The Notebook. <br>
        
        <i>Favourite Music: </i> Oldies, mood setting music, and music overall. I don't however enjoy hard rock, nor rap. I enjoy mood music with ocean, bird and nature sounds to end the days chaotic ways.

        <h3>Sparkie's Homefire Setting</h3>
<p>
    As you enter this website using your imagination you will find a couch and a few recliner chairs. In the center of the
    room is a burl wooden coffee table to rest your mug of hot chocolate, tea, or coffee on. A crackling fire in the
    circular rock fireplace, and serenity that one can only find when in the forest near a mountaintop, and magnificent lake
    compliments soft music in the background. <br>
    <br>
    
    Babbling brooks and gentle waterfalls flow through the pebbles that lay within the confines of this homepage. As the
    dancing flames flicker their beauty on the walls that surround us, 
    </p>

   <p>
may you take with you on this journey through
Sparkie's heart written work, the warmth, love, and calm that resides within her. <br>
<br>

May the wonderment of natures sounds begin to drip warmth over you as you sit here and take in a moment to explore
Sparkie's Home Fires! The refrigerator is full of fine wines, imported cheese, thick steaks, cracked crab, and specialty
dips for one to satisfy the hunger of the pallet, while reaching into the poems to satisfy the hunger of ones soul. </p>
